## Additional files

- Order definition: Defines the wavelength solution of the instruments. For convenience, these are provided with the installation of this module. You need to make sure you add them to your folder before creating your observations.
- Blaze functions: If known, we provide the blaze functions. It is theoretically not necessary, but makes your data look more 'realistic'.
